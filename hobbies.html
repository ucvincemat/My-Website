                I occassionally do digital art. My style leans more into cartoonish rather than realism. <br><br>
                To the right is my depiction of <b>Dr Felipe Pati Jr</b>, being one of the iconic teachers of my University.<br><br>
                Please do not let him know about this, at all costs.

                <h1><u>MUSIC</u></h1>
                I tend to compose music digitally. I often use open-source freeware as DAWs such as Ultrabox.<br><br>
                As a sample, below is one of my compositions named <b>"Double Time! Over Time!"</b>

                <h1><u>GAMES</u></h1>
                I play a lot of video games in my free time. I often sink time into games I already play.<br><br>
                More often than not, I buy and play games on the <i>Steam</i> platform. With the exeption of Minecraft and Roblox.<br><br>
                At some point, I plan to make my own video game, as the indie scene is getting more popular.
